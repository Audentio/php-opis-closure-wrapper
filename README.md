# Audentio Opis Closure Wrapper

This library is a wrapper for the [opis/closure](https://github.com/opis/closure/) library which fixes some issues with handling DateTime objects. For any of this functionality to work you must call the serialize and unserialize functions from the `Audentio\OpisClosureWrapper` namespace.
